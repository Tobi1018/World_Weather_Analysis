# Project Overview




## Delivery One 

In the delivery one, I generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data gathered in the module, I make use of API Knowledge to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Afterward, create a new DataFrame with the updated weather data.

## Delivery Two

In delivery two, I make use of input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Created a marker layer map with pop-up markers that displays those destinations.

## Delivery Three

In delivery three, I make use of Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Using the marker layer, create pop-up markers for each destination on the itinerary.
